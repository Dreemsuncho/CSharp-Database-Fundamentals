# C# Databases Fundamentals - September 2017

Databases are the standard way to use dynamic information in modern technologies, making them an integral part of almost every application. In the C # Database Fundamentals module you will be introduced to one of the most widely used Microsoft SQL Server database management systems. In the second part of the module, the focus is on the de facto standard for object-oriented data modeling in C # and .NET applications - the Entity Framework

### Module Courses
- #### Databases Basics MS SQL Server 
  - Intensive course basics of databases will introduce you to one of the most widely used database management systems (DBMS) used in the development of modern information systems - Microsoft SQL Server. The course focuses on relational modeling, data modeling with ER charts (tables and relational links) and SQL language handling (data mining, selection, projection, joining, aggregation, grouping, modification, deletion and insertion). Fundamental knowledge about ACID transactions and transaction processing and practical tips for adjusting productivity are provided.
  This course sets the basics of working with databases, making it easier to use them in real-world applications, and understanding concepts such as database transformation into object-oriented (ORM) modeling.

 - #### Databases Advanced - Entity Framework
 	- We will look in detail at working with a modern ORM technology: Entity Framework (EF), which is a standard ORM standard in C # and .NET applications. EF allows mapping between a relational base and object-oriented model using the "database first" and "code first" approaches and provides a powerful object-oriented API for querying the database and performing CRUD operations. We will demonstrate established practices in building a database layer on sophisticated systems using the "Repository" and "Unit of Work" templates.
During the course a practical team project will be developed that includes practical use of different DB servers (SQL Server, MySQL), data access platforms and technologies (ADO.NET, Entity Framework, etc.) and import and export to various formats for data (JSON, XML).
